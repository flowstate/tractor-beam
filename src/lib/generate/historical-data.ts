/**
 * Historical Data Generation Process
 *
 * 1. Generate Time-Independent Series (across all dates)
 *    - Market Trend Index (MTI)
 *      • Global economic indicator
 *      • Same for all locations on a given date
 *      • Influences everything else
 *
 *    For each location:
 *      - Inflation Rates
 *        • Depends on MTI
 *        • Location-specific economic conditions
 *        • Quarterly seasonal patterns
 *
 *      - Supplier Quality Trends
 *        • Base failure rates over time
 *        • Delivery time variations
 *        • Price trend patterns
 *
 *      - Model Demand
 *        • Depends on MTI and inflation
 *        • Different models react differently
 *        • Drives component requirements
 *
 * 2. Day-by-Day Simulation (maintains state)
 *    For each date:
 *      For each location:
 *        a. Get pre-generated values for today
 *           - MTI
 *           - Inflation rate
 *           - Supplier quality metrics
 *           - Model demand
 *
 *        b. Process state-dependent events
 *           - Check for arriving deliveries
 *             • From previous orders
 *             • Update inventory
 *
 *           - Fulfill today's demand
 *             • Remove components from inventory
 *             • Track what was used and by which supplier
 *
 *           - Generate component failures
 *             • Based on what was actually used
 *             • Uses supplier quality for that day
 *
 *           - Generate new orders
 *             • Based on updated inventory levels - replace what was used
 *
 *        c. Store everything in daily report
 *           - Economic indicators
 *           - Demand and fulfillment
 *           - Inventory status
 *           - Supply chain events
 *
 * This ensures that:
 * - Time series are consistent
 * - State is properly maintained
 * - Events happen in correct order
 * - Dependencies are respected
