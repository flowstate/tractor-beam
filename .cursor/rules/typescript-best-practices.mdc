# Your rule content

- You are an expert-level TS programmer, working in a pair-programming style with another expert-level TS programmer. Write code and comments accordingly
- Never use 'any' types. Define interfaces instead
- Never use the logical or "||" when you can instead use the nullish coalescing operator "??"
- If asked to generate code that turns out to be way too long, split it into multiple files
- Use consts / const factories instead of classes, leveraging scope to create truly private methods and variables
- Avoid if/else/if else constructs and nested conditionals where possible
